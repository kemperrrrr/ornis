//! Port: render analysis output, dimension by dimension.
//!
//! Sealed two-trait pattern:
//! - [`Reporter`] is the single public entry point: `render(findings,
//!   data) -> Output`. External crates cannot implement it (the
//!   [`sealed::Sealed`] supertrait lives in a private module).
//! - [`ReporterImpl`] is the contract every concrete reporter satisfies
//!   internally: per-dim `build_*` projections + a final `publish` that
//!   composes the per-dim [`Snapshot`] into the reporter's `Output`.
//! - [`Snapshot`] aggregates the ten per-dim views; its fields are
//!   `pub(crate)` so external code cannot construct one and therefore
//!   cannot reach `publish` directly.
//!
//! Adding a new dimension means: extend [`ReporterImpl`] with a `type
//! FooView` + `fn build_foo`, add `foo` to [`Snapshot`], and add the
//! corresponding line to the blanket `render` constructor below. Every
//! existing reporter then fails to compile until it adds the
//! corresponding pieces — the compile-time Reporter-Parity guarantee.

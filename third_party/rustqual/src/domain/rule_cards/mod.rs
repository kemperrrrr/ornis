//! Rule cards — the single source of truth for per-rule metadata.
//!
//! Every reporter that names a rule renders from this registry: the SARIF
//! `tool.driver.rules` table, `--explain <RULE-ID>`, and the text summary's
//! rule titles. One card per stable catalog id; adding a rule means adding a
//! card here (the SARIF sync test enforces set equality).

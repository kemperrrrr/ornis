//! Per-function record consumed by the IOSP and Complexity dimensions.
//!
//! `FunctionRecord` is the typed state-of-codebase representation of a
//! single analyzed function. It carries everything reporters need to
//! render the per-function view — both classification (IOSP lens) and
//! raw complexity metrics (Complexity lens) — plus identity and a few
//! cross-cutting flags (`is_test`, `suppressed`, …).
//!
//! Violation-specific detail (logic_locations, call_locations) lives on
//! `IospFinding`, not here. `FunctionRecord` is state, not findings.

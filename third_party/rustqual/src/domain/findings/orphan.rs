//! Orphan-suppression Finding type.
//!
//! Cross-cutting Finding produced when a `// qual:allow(...)` marker should
//! be reported: it is *stale* (matched no finding in its window — a stale or
//! misplaced suppression) or *too-loose* (a metric pin sitting further above
//! the value it covers than `pin_headroom` allows). Lives in `domain::findings`
//! alongside the per-dimension Finding types so the Reporter port can
//! treat orphan rendering as a compile-time-required projection
//! (`ReporterImpl::OrphanView` + `build_orphans`), preventing future
//! reporters from silently omitting orphan output.

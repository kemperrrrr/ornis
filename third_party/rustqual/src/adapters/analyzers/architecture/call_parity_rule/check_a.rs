//! Check A — Adapter-must-delegate.
//!
//! Every `pub fn` in a configured adapter layer must reach at least one
//! fn in the configured target layer (within `call_depth` adapter-
//! internal hops). A fn that satisfies this delegates to the shared
//! Application layer; a fn that fails has almost certainly inlined
//! business logic.
//!
//! Reads from the shared `HandlerTouchpoints` cache built by
//! `mod::build_handler_touchpoints` — the cache already encodes the
//! same forward-BFS-with-boundary-stop semantic Check A needs, so we
//! only need to test whether a handler's touchpoint set is empty.
//! Deprecated handlers are filtered upstream (absent from the cache)
//! and silently skipped here.

//! Workspace-wide canonical call graph shared by Check A and Check B.
//!
//! Walks every fn (free + impl, pub + private) across non-cfg-test files,
//! turns each into a canonical name (`crate::<file_module>::<fn>` or
//! `crate::<file_module>::<Type>::<method>`), and records:
//!
//! - `forward[caller] = {callees}` — what each fn calls.
//! - `reverse[callee] = {callers}` — inverse of `forward`, pre-built so
//!   Check B's BFS doesn't pay O(N) lookup per step.
//!
//! Layer membership of a given node is derived on demand via
//! `LayerDefinitions::layer_of_crate_path(canonical)` rather than cached
//! per-file. A per-canonical file map would silently overwrite on name
//! collisions (trait-impl vs inherent `Type::method` with identical
//! canonical), and layer derivation from the canonical path is both
//! deterministic and consistent with Check A's forward walk.
//!
//! Private fns are needed because adapters commonly delegate through
//! file-local helpers — walking only pub fns would under-count delegation
//! chains and trigger false positives in Check A.

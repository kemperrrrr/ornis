//! Boundary-only touchpoint computation.
//!
//! Given a handler's canonical name and the workspace call graph, walk
//! forward (BFS) through adapter-internal helpers up to `call_depth`
//! hops. Once a node in the **target layer** is reached, record it as a
//! touchpoint and **do not** descend into its callees. The walk
//! terminates either on depth exhaustion or when no unvisited neighbors
//! remain.
//!
//! This is the shared core for the four call-parity checks:
//!
//! - Check A fails when the returned set is empty (no delegation).
//! - Check B fails when a touchpoint is in some adapter's coverage but
//!   missing from another's.
//! - Check C fails when a single handler's touchpoint set has size > 1.
//! - Check D fails when per-touchpoint counts diverge across adapters.
//!
//! The boundary stop is the semantic distinguisher from leaf-reachability:
//! application-internal call chains (e.g. `session.search` →
//! `record_operation` → `impact_count`) are NOT inspected. Only the
//! first crossing into the target layer counts.

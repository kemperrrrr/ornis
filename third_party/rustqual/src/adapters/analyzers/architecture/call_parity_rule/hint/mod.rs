//! Discoverable hints for `CallParityMissingAdapter` findings —
//! point the author at private + non-stdlib-attributed fns in the
//! missing adapter that would resolve the finding if their attribute
//! were promoted via `[architecture.call_parity] promoted_attributes`.
//! See `candidates::collect_private_candidates` for the candidate-
//! selection walk and `enrich_with_hints` for how candidates are
//! projected onto findings.
//!
//! Reachability check uses the SAME `compute_touchpoints` walker the
//! production check uses. No parallel reachability logic — any
//! `call_depth` / peer-adapter / boundary-stop change in the walker
//! flows through automatically. A candidate appears in the hint iff
//! `compute_touchpoints(candidate)` (treating the candidate as if it
//! were a handler) contains the unreached target — i.e. promoting
//! its attribute will ACTUALLY put the target in the adapter's
//! coverage set.

/// what is covered.
///
/// `visit_field` is **not** here: one collector reads serde attributes off a
/// field, so writing it out keeps that visible to the call graph rather than
/// hiding it behind a macro the analyzer cannot see through.
///
/// Body nodes are in the list too. An earlier version left them out on the
/// grounds that "the enclosing item already decided", which confused *the item
/// is production* with *everything in it is production* — precisely what `cfg`
/// does not mean. A `#[cfg(test)] let` is absent from a non-test build, so what
/// it names is a test reference.
///
/// The list is derived rather than guessed: `syn` has sixty-nine structs with
/// an `attrs` field, and they reach a visitor through the dispatches named here
/// (`Item`, `ImplItem`, `TraitItem`, `ForeignItem`, `Stmt`, `Expr`, `Pat`,
/// `GenericParam`) or as their own node (`Field`, `Variant`, `Arm`,
/// `FieldValue`, `FieldPat`, `BareFnArg`, `Receiver`, `Variadic`,
/// `BareVariadic`). That is all of them.
///
/// The signature and generic positions were once left out on the theory that an
/// attribute there cannot remove a reference. It can: `fn(#[cfg(test)] Fixture)`
/// and `struct Holder<#[cfg(test)] T = Fixture>` both compile, and both drop the
/// only mention of `Fixture` outside a test build. Checking what the compiler
/// accepts beats reasoning about it.
///
/// `File` is the one attributed node handled elsewhere — its inner attributes
/// are what the whole-file test classification reads, one level up.

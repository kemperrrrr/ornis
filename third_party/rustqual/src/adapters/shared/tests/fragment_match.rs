//! The rule a forwarded fragment follows, as a table rather than as anecdote.
//!
//! Three review rounds in a row found the same defect one layer deeper: a
//! metavariable handed to another macro was judged by how it *looks* — accepted
//! because it contained a `$`, then because substituting an identifier parsed.
//! What decides is the Rust reference:
//!
//! > When forwarding a matched fragment to another macro-by-example, matchers
//! > in the second macro will see an opaque AST of the fragment type. The second
//! > macro can't use literal tokens to match the fragments in the matcher, only
//! > a fragment specifier of the same type. The `ident`, `lifetime`, and `tt`
//! > fragment types are an exception, and can be matched by literal tokens.
//!
//! Enumerating every pair pins that sentence instead of the last example that
//! went wrong. A row that drifts fails here, not three rounds later.

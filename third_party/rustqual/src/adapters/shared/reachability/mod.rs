//! Can an item be named from *outside* its crate?
//!
//! `// qual:api` exists to excuse an entry point whose callers live outside the
//! analysed code. That excuse only makes sense for items an outside consumer
//! can actually reach: `pub`, behind an unbroken chain of `pub mod`, in a
//! library crate. An item behind a private `mod` is unreachable no matter how
//! many `pub` keywords it carries — a `qual:api` there is a category error.
//!
//! The derivation is pure `.rs`-set analysis (no `Cargo.toml`, matching the
//! rest of rustqual): one walk starts at every crate root
//! (`shared::crate_roots`), follows `mod` declarations through the shared
//! layout rules (`shared::child_paths`) and gathers the visibility and
//! `pub use` facts (`collect`); this module closes over them — `pub mod`
//! links, glob preludes, and re-export chains including renames.
//!
//! **The bias is deliberate: every uncertainty resolves to *reachable*.** The
//! consumer reports a marker as "never applied" when an item is unreachable,
//! so a wrong "unreachable" would demand deleting a marker that is still doing
//! its job. Missing a re-export costs a finding; inventing one costs trust.
//!
//! **Known limit, in that safe direction (issue #40):** items are identified
//! by `(file, name)`. Two same-named functions in *different inline modules of
//! one file* — say a `pub` one in `mod shown` and a private one in
//! `mod hidden` — are indistinguishable, so the public one makes the private
//! one look reachable and a stale marker on it goes unreported. Fixing this
//! needs a qualified item key threaded through `DeclaredFunction` and the
//! analyzers that share it; that is its own piece of work, and its payoff is
//! capped anyway because call sites are recorded by last path segment (see
//! `dry::call_targets`), so declarations alone cannot attribute a call.

//! Orphan-suppression detector.
//!
//! An orphan `// qual:allow(...)` marker is one worth reporting: either
//! *stale* — it matches no finding within its annotation window (the
//! underlying finding was fixed or moved, or the annotation is misplaced) —
//! or *too-loose* — a metric pin that does match a finding but sits further
//! above the value it covers than `pin_headroom` allows. Orphans are emitted
//! as a distinct finding category (`ORPHAN_SUPPRESSION`) so they show up in
//! every output format (text, JSON, AI, SARIF, ...) just like any other
//! finding — one-shot `--format ai` invocations don't miss them.

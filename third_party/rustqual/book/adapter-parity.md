# Use case: adapter parity (call parity)

If your project has multiple frontends — a CLI, an MCP server, a REST API, a web UI — they're supposed to expose the same underlying capabilities. In theory, every CLI command has a matching MCP handler. In practice, it drifts. Someone adds a new application function, MCP picks it up, CLI forgets, and three months later you discover `cmd_export` exists in one adapter but not the other.

**Call Parity makes adapter symmetry a CI-checkable property, not a code-review hope.** It's rustqual's most opinionated architecture rule, and one I haven't found a direct equivalent for in any other Rust static analyzer.

## What it checks

Configure adapter layers and a shared target. Minimal example with two adapters:

```toml
[architecture.layers]
order = ["domain", "application", "cli", "mcp"]

[architecture.layers.application]
paths = ["src/application/**"]

[architecture.layers.cli]
paths = ["src/cli/**"]

[architecture.layers.mcp]
paths = ["src/mcp/**"]

[architecture.call_parity]
adapters = ["cli", "mcp"]
target   = "application"
```

`adapters` can list any number of peer layers — REST endpoints, web handlers, gRPC servers, message-queue consumers — they're treated identically.

Four checks run under one rule, all anchored at the **boundary** — the first call from an adapter into the target layer:

- **Check A — every adapter must delegate.** Each `pub fn` in an adapter layer must reach into the `target` layer. A CLI command that doesn't actually call into the application layer is logic in the wrong place. Caught at build time.
- **Check B — touchpoint sets must match.** Each target `pub fn` reached from one adapter must be reached from every adapter (or excluded explicitly). Add `app::ingest::run`, forget to wire it into CLI, and Check B reports exactly that — by name, in CI, before review.
- **Check C — single touchpoint per handler.** Each adapter `pub fn` should have exactly one touchpoint in the target layer. Multi-touchpoint handlers orchestrate across application calls themselves — that orchestration logic risks divergence between adapters. Configurable severity (`single_touchpoint = "off" | "warn" | "error"`, default `warn`).
- **Check D — multiplicity must match.** When two adapters both reach the same target capability, they must reach it with the same handler count. cli having `cmd_search` + `cmd_grep` (alias) both reach `session.search` while mcp has only `handle_search` is API surface drift, even though Check B is silent.

### Touchpoints — what counts and what doesn't

A **touchpoint** is the first node in the target layer reached when walking forward from an adapter pub-fn through adapter-internal helpers. The walk stops on first target hit and does not descend into target callees. Two kinds of nodes count as target boundaries:

- **Concrete target pub-fns** — direct calls into application-layer functions (`session.search`).
- **Trait-method anchors** — synthetic `<Trait>::<method>` nodes emitted by `dyn Trait.method()` dispatch, recognised as a boundary when (0) the trait declaration is workspace-visible per the shared `visible_canonicals` set — covering `pub`, `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)`, `pub(in <path>)`, file-backed module visibility, public re-exports, and inline-mod visibility chains; private traits and pub-traits-inside-private-mods are implementation detail and excluded, AND (a) the trait declaration is NOT in a peer-adapter layer, AND (b) the trait declaration IS in the target layer with a callable body (default OR overriding impl), OR at least one overriding impl lives in the target layer. Inherited-default impls in target (`impl T for X {}` where `T::method` has its default body declared outside target) do NOT promote — the body lives at the trait's declaring layer and isn't modelled as a target node. The anchor itself can live in any non-peer-adapter layer (typically `ports` for Hexagonal, or `application` itself for in-target traits). Check B/D enumerate anchors alongside concrete target pub-fns when computing coverage and multiplicity, and skip concrete impl-method pub-fns that an enumerated anchor already covers — **but only when no adapter has the concrete in its boundary coverage**. When an adapter reaches the capability via direct concrete call (`LoggingHandler::handle()` UFCS or static-method form) and another via `dyn Trait` dispatch, the concrete pass still runs so mixed-form drift surfaces as paired concrete + anchor findings (cross-form synonym handling stays intentionally out of scope). When ALL adapters cover the capability via direct concrete call (no dispatch anywhere), the anchor pass is silenced — the capability IS covered, just via the concrete form. `exclude_targets` globs match against both the anchor canonical and any `impl_method_canonical` it backs, so a single user-friendly impl-path glob (`application::admin::*`) silences both the concrete and anchor forms without needing a parallel ports-path entry. Anchor findings carry the trait method's actual declaration line so suppression markers and SARIF locations work correctly.

The walker refuses to promote anchors declared in **peer-adapter layers** (e.g. `mcp::Handler` from a `cli`-origin walk) to target boundaries — otherwise `cli` could inherit `mcp`'s coverage by dispatching through MCP's port trait.

This boundary stop is deliberate: application-internal call chains (`session.search → record_operation → impact_count`) aren't a parity concern. If two adapters both reach `session.search`, the parity question is answered. What `session.search` does internally is `DRY-002`'s job, not `call_parity`'s.

`call_depth` (default 3) bounds the **adapter-internal** traversal — the maximum number of call edges the boundary BFS follows from the adapter pub-fn before giving up. Direct callees sit at depth 1, so `call_depth = 3` covers `handler → h1 → h2 → target` (three edges, two intermediate helpers). It does not constrain post-boundary application chain depth.

### Deprecated-handler exclusion

Adapter `pub fn`s marked with `#[deprecated]` (in any form: bare,
`#[deprecated = "..."]`, or `#[deprecated(since = "...", note = "...")]`)
are excluded from Checks A/B/C/D. Aliases that are explicitly being
phased out shouldn't drag the parity report.

```rust
#[deprecated = "use cmd_search"]
pub fn cmd_grep(args: ClapArgs) { /* … */ }   // skipped from parity
```

### Known limitations

Call-parity handles most type-alias, re-export, and trait-dispatch
shapes (`pub type Public = Box<private::Hidden>`, multi-step chains,
transparent-wrapper peeling, `dyn Trait` collapsed to synthetic
anchors, file-backed module visibility, `pub use` re-export
rewriting at call sites (since 1.2.3), generic-param trait dispatch
`Q::method()` (UFCS, since 1.2.3) and `q.method()` (receiver-position
method call where `q: &Q` and `Q: Trait`, since 1.2.4), concrete
inherent UFCS into sibling submodules
(`use response::T; T::new()`, since 1.2.4), and private fns promoted
to the handler surface via
`[architecture.call_parity] promoted_attributes` for proc-macro
frameworks like rmcp `#[tool]` / axum `#[handler]` (since 1.2.3)).
The patterns below can still produce false-negative Check-B coverage
or leave a call unresolved — bullets 1–2 are type-alias edge cases,
3 is a nested re-export in receiver position (call-site `pub use`
rewriting is handled since 1.2.3, but receiver-type re-exports are
not), 4 is a public function re-export visible only via `pub use`,
5 is internals of trait default bodies, 6 is an ambiguous
inherited-default UFCS form. Workarounds are listed inline:

1. **Generic-identity aliases at use sites.** A `type Id<T> = T;` and
   then `pub type Public = Id<private::Hidden>;` registers `Id` in
   the visible-types set, but receiver inference resolves callers
   `x: Public` directly to `Hidden`. Methods on `Hidden` therefore
   stay outside the public surface even though they are reachable
   through `Public`. Workaround: declare the inner type publicly, or
   alias without the generic identity wrapper. A correct fix would
   substitute alias generic parameters at use sites while still
   refusing to peel nominal generic types like `struct Wrapper<T>`.

2. **Impl blocks keyed under an alias.** `pub type Public =
   private::Hidden; impl Public { pub fn op(&self) {} }` keys the
   impl method under `Public::op`, but a caller with `x: Public`
   resolves to `Hidden::op` after alias expansion. Workaround: write
   the impl block against the underlying type (`impl Hidden`). A
   correct fix would chase the alias chain in `resolve_impl_self_type`
   and register methods under every alias-equivalent canonical.

3. **Nested re-exports in receiver position.** `pub mod outer { …
   pub use self::private::Hidden; }` followed by `fn h(x: outer::Hidden)
   { x.op() }` — the receiver-type resolver does not chase workspace
   `pub use` re-exports inside nested modules, so the parameter
   resolves to `crate::…::outer::Hidden` while the impl method lives
   under `crate::…::outer::private::Hidden`. Visibility recognises
   both paths, but the call-graph edge ends up under the short
   `<method>:op` form. Workaround: write the impl at the file-level
   qualified path (`impl outer::Hidden { … }`) so impl-canonical
   and caller-canonical agree, or `qual:allow(architecture, call_parity)` at the
   call-site.

4. **Public function re-exports.** `mod private { pub fn op() {} }
   pub use private::op;` — the visibility pass chases type
   re-exports through `chase_alias_chain` in `walk_use_tree`, but
   value re-exports (functions, consts, statics) are intentionally
   filtered out (they would otherwise leak same-named private types
   into the visible-type set). The trade-off: a function exposed
   only via `pub use` is missed by the target pub-fn set, so Check
   B/D may not require adapter coverage for it. Workaround: declare
   the function at a publicly-reachable path directly, or wrap it
   in a public struct method.

5. **Calls inside trait default-method bodies.** `trait Handler {
   fn handle(&self) { self.helper(); } }` — `dyn Handler.handle()`
   resolves to the trait-method anchor `<Handler>::handle`, but the
   workspace call graph doesn't model `TraitItemFn::default` as a
   node, so calls **inside** the default body (`self.helper()`)
   stay invisible to Check A/B/D. Workaround: override the method
   explicitly in each impl, or move the body into a free function
   the trait method delegates to.

6. **Ambiguous inherited-default UFCS calls.** When one impl type
   implements multiple traits with the same default method name
   (e.g. `impl Greeting for X {}` + `impl Logging for X {}` where
   both traits declare `fn handle(&self) {}`), a UFCS call like
   `X::handle(&x)` would require Rust-side `<X as Greeting>::handle`
   disambiguation. From the canonical alone we can't tell which
   trait was selected, so the edge-rewrite pass leaves the call
   unresolved rather than guessing. Workaround: rename the methods,
   override on the impl, or call through `dyn Trait` (which
   resolves the anchor unambiguously).

If you hit any of these patterns in practice, please open an issue
with the exact alias / re-export / dispatch shape — the fixes
touch several call sites in the call-parity pipeline and we'd like
a real-world example to drive the substitution semantics rather
than guessing.

## Why this is unusual

Static analyzers traditionally fall into two camps:

- **Style and local linters** (Clippy, ESLint, RuboCop) enforce per-function rules. They don't know your architecture.
- **Architecture linters** (ArchUnit, dependency-cruiser) enforce **containment**: "domain doesn't import adapters", "infrastructure doesn't depend on application". They prove what *can't* be called.

Neither proves what **must** be called — that several adapter modules *collectively cover every public capability* of a target module. That requires building a real call graph across files, resolving method receivers through type aliases, wrappers, re-exports, and `Self`, then reverse-walking from each adapter to see what target functions it actually reaches.

I haven't found another tool — for any language — that does this out of the box. The closest neighbours are general-purpose graph queries on top of CodeQL or Joern, where you write the analysis from scratch every time. If you know of one, I'd genuinely like to hear about it.

## The hard part: an honest call graph

The rule itself is simple. The work is making the call graph honest. Real Rust code looks like:

```rust
let session = Session::open_cwd().map_err(map_err)?;
session.diff(path).map_err(map_err)?;
```

A naive analyzer sees `.diff()` on something it can't name and gives up — that turns into a false-positive "your CLI doesn't reach the application." rustqual ships a shallow type-inference engine that resolves receivers end-to-end:

- Method-chain constructors and stdlib combinator returns (`Result::map_err`, `Option::ok`, `Future::await`, `Result::inspect`, …)
- Field access chains (`ctx.session.diff()`)
- Trait dispatch on `dyn Trait` and `impl Trait` collapses to a single synthetic anchor `<Trait>::<method>` representing the logical capability — the call graph **does not** fan out to per-impl edges, which would otherwise turn one boundary call into N touchpoints and falsely fire Check C. The walker recognises the anchor as a target boundary when (a) the trait is declared in the target layer with a callable body (default OR overriding impl), OR (b) at least one overriding impl lives in the target layer. Inherited-default impls (empty `impl T for X {}` whose body lives on the trait elsewhere) do not promote — the body isn't modelled as a target node.
- Type aliases — including chains, wrappers (`Box<Hidden>`), and re-exports
- Renamed imports (`use std::sync::Arc as Shared;`) — with shadow detection so a local `crate::wrap::Arc` doesn't masquerade as stdlib
- `Self` substitution across all resolver paths so impl-internal delegation works

Anything that can't be resolved cleanly stays unresolved — no fabricated edges. **False positives kill architectural rules**; missing an edge is recoverable, inventing one isn't.

## Framework extractors and macro transparency

Web frameworks wrap state in extractor types (`State<T>`, `Data<T>`, `Json<T>`). Without help, the call graph stops at the extractor. Add them as transparent wrappers:

```toml
[architecture.call_parity]
adapters = ["cli", "mcp"]
target   = "application"
transparent_wrappers = ["State", "Extension", "Json", "Data"]
transparent_macros   = ["tracing::instrument", "async_trait::async_trait"]
```

Now `fn h(State(db): State<Db>) { db.query() }` resolves through the `State<T>` peel and the `Db::query` edge is recorded.

The default `transparent_macros` list already covers the common cases; entries here extend it.

## What you'll see

In `--findings` (one-line) output, real findings look like:

```
src/cli/commands/sync.rs:12  ARCHITECTURE  adapter cli::cmd_sync does not delegate to 'application' within 3 adapter-internal call edges: call parity
src/application/export.rs:8  ARCHITECTURE  'crate::application::export::run_export' is not reached from adapter layer(s): cli: call parity
```

(In `--format json` these surface under the top-level `architecture_findings[]` array; in `--format sarif` as `result` entries with `ruleId = "architecture/call_parity/no_delegation"` / `"…/missing_adapter"`. Full rule-ID list: [reference-rules.md](./reference-rules.md).)

The first says "this CLI command does logic locally instead of delegating". The second says "you added a new application capability and forgot to expose it via CLI".

## Excluding legitimate asymmetries

Sometimes a target function genuinely shouldn't have an adapter for every frontend — debug endpoints, admin-only tooling, internal setup. Use `exclude_targets`:

```toml
[architecture.call_parity]
adapters = ["cli", "mcp"]
target   = "application"
exclude_targets = [
    "application::admin::*",     # admin tools, not exposed via either adapter
    "application::setup::run",   # bootstrap, called once at startup
]
```

Globs match against the *module path* (with `crate::` stripped), not the layer name. `application::admin::*` matches every `pub fn` under `src/application/admin/**`.

For ad-hoc per-function suppression:

```rust
// qual:allow(architecture, call_parity) reason: "internal capability, intentionally MCP-only"
pub fn admin_purge() { /* … */ }
```

## Why the false-positive rate matters

False positives don't just waste reviewer time, they *teach the team to ignore the tool*. The whole call-parity approach only works if the false-positive rate stays close to zero — which is why the receiver-type-inference engine refuses to fabricate edges. An honest "I don't know" beats a confident wrong answer when the rule is going to fail builds.

## For teams using AI coding assistants

If you're building Rust with Copilot, Claude, Codex, or similar: this rule guards against one of the more common patterns of architectural drift in AI-assisted codebases. When an agent adds `pub fn export_csv()` to your application layer, it tends to wire it into one frontend and forget the others. Check B catches that on the next `cargo` run — before the PR — without you having to write a custom prompt or review checklist.

Combined with rustqual's other architecture rules (layers, forbidden edges, trait contracts), this gives any LLM agent a *structural* feedback loop that's stricter and more reliable than narrative architectural documentation in a repo's README.

## Try it

```toml
# rustqual.toml
[architecture]
enabled = true
[architecture.layers]
order = ["domain", "application", "cli", "mcp"]
# ... layer paths ...

[architecture.call_parity]
adapters = ["cli", "mcp"]
target   = "application"
```

```sh
cargo install rustqual
rustqual . --fail-on-warnings
```
